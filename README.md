# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods
<br><br>
1- Maximize insight into a data set;<br>2- Uncover underlying structure;
<br>3-Extract important variables;
<br>4-Detect outliers and anomalies;
<br>5-Test underlying assumptions;
<br>6-Develop parsimonious models; 
<br>7-Determine optimal factor settings.

## TECHNIQUES
The particular graphical techniques employed in EDA are often quite simple, consisting of various techniques of:

- Plotting the raw data (such as data traces, histograms, bihistograms, probability plots, lag plots, block plots.
- Plotting simple statistics such as mean plots, standard deviation plots, box plots, and main effects plots of the raw data.
- Positioning such plots so as to maximize our natural pattern-recognition abilities.

You can see my notebook. All  the work is explained in detail.
